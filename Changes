0.009   2019-06-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        [Script: list-calendar-dates]

	- Add options --min-year, --max-year.

	- [ux] Add short aliases -Y for --year, -M for --month, -D for --day.

	- [ux] [incompatible change] By default, --all-years only shows dates at
	  most 10 years to the back and future, to avoid showing too many years
	  (e.g. up to year 9999) for anniversaries. User will need to specify
	  --all-entries (-A) to show dates beyond that range.

	- [ux] Add -L option to list all Calendar::Dates::* modules. This is
	  mostly a convenience so we don't have to use the separate script
	  list-calendar-dates-modules.

	- [bugfix] Fix schema for month and day (used 'between' instead of 'in'
	  clause).
